# io_mesh_bmdl

Blender import/export addon for 3D Movie Maker's BMDL, based on [code written by Foone](https://github.com/foone/7gen)
Saves time exporting to OBJ and converting it to BMDL.

## Installation

Install like any other Blender addon, extract to your `scripts/addons` folder.

## TODO

- find out a better way to export UVs (currently, edges have to be split for them to work correctly)
- normals, maybe
